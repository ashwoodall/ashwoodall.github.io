title: Goodbye World, Hello Hack Reactor
---

For the first time ever, I completed all of the monthly tasks in my bullet journal on time. It was a really weird month, but I hit some big life milestones (got married, committed to a full career change):

I marked off ‘Start Hack Reactor’ because I was officially accepted to the June cohort today! I was kind of on the edge of this and the August cohort since I technically interviewed after the deadline for June passed. I’m so excited to start the 13 week immersive software engineering program on Monday, although I’m a tiny bit nervous too!

## Precourse is tough.

To be honest, I hugely underestimated Hack Reactor’s exclusivity and just how difficult being admitted to the program would be. I have a few friends that completed the program back when it was MakerSquare. All of them are doing very well for themselves now, and encouraged me to apply ASAP. I didn’t do a ton of research about the Hack Reactor interview beforehand; I was just really frustrated with how my junior dev interviews were going (most were looking for CS or bootcamp grads) and I knew there were some glaring holes in my knowledge/experience (ahem, pair programming/working with a team).

Let me back up a little and explain some of my story. I’ve been teaching myself how to be a developer for the last year or so, not necessarily how to get admitted to a bootcamp. I’ve learned A LOT about different technologies, including basic javascript programming, but while I was studying wide on all of these topics – I did not necessarily do a deep dive into any of them. I thought I had a pretty solid understanding of javascript, and then Hack Reactor opened my eyes to the magical land of higher order functions (and functional programming concepts, in general). I studied harder in the last month than I think I ever did in grad school. The reality is that most likely my type A personality shook hands with my imposter syndrome and forced me to way over-study (including during my honeymoon!), but hey – that’s just me. And that is probably the same personality of anyone who would consider embarking on this kind of bootcamp experience.

## But it’s worth it.

There are a lot of opinions floating around out there about Hack Reactor (I’ve had some skepticism in the past), but as somebody who has already completed a lot of school, I’m sure it is like any learning experience and will only be as useful as the amount of work the student puts into it. Nobody can learn for you. I honestly feel like I’ve already gotten a lot out of working through the precourse work and while prepping for the technical interview.

Okay, I did have some other stuff going on too.

Yes, my wedding was also earlier this month. If I had been aware of the HUGE time commitment of the precourse work, I might have considered pushing my start date to August. But I survived my wedding, and had a BLAST during it and my honeymoon. All in all, I think this timeline is working out for the best. I often think of the lines in Max Ehrmann’s “Desiderata” –

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

That’s printed in my bullet journal too.

## Prepping for the next 13 weeks.

So, my plan is to totally decompress this weekend, clear my head, and mentally prepare for what’s coming. I also need to buy a bus pass. I’m not sure how often I’ll be able to blog during the program, but I’ll do my best.
