title: Favorite Movies of 2017
---

Okay, so maybe a more accurate title for this post would be, "Favorite Cinematic Experiences" of 2017. Absolutely nothing was able to beat seeing Pandora and the Flying Dutchman at Le Champo in Paris this year. Instead of just rating my top 10 movies this year (even though this was a great year for movies), I decided to go back over my favorite experiences watching movies this year. 

1. Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (1951)
2. Baby Driver (2017)
3. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)
4. Wonder Woman (2017)
3. Get Out (2017)
4. It (2017)
5. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)
6. La La Land (2016)
7. Before Sunrise (1995)
8. Logan (2017)
9. The Big Sick (2017)
10. Hidden Figures (2017)
