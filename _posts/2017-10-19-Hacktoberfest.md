I just completed DigitalOcean's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!

Hacktoberfest is a great way to get started contributing to open source projects, and I imagine it's a great way for companies to get a lot of code written very quickly! Participating projects tag their repo with #Hacktoberfest tag, and individuals looking to gain a sweet free tshirt make 4 PRs before October 31st.

Most of my PRs were to Free Code Camp's [guides](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guides), which is a wikipedia-like resource for new programmers. The repo is filled with stubs for articles that need to be fleshed out, so it's easy to pick something interesting up and help out. I ended up contributing resources for Bootstrap and CSS3, although the repo currently has 1,529 open PRs, so it might take awhile for mine to be merged :)

I had a great experience contributing this year, and look forward to contributing to more open soure projects in the future.
